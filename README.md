# Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship Projects (OIBSIP)

Welcome to the Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship Projects (OIBSIP) repository! This repository contains the code and resources for the data science projects tasks that were completed during the internship. The projects covers topics like data science and  machine learning. I encourage you to explore the projects and learn from them.

## Task 1: Iris Flower Classification

This project classifies Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The project uses a machine learning model to learn from the measurements of the iris flowers (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and classify them.
